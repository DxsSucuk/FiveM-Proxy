# FiveM Reverse Proxy
This a PoC/Prototyp made in Java.

# DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION
I do not recommend using it in production because it is very shit and doesnt really allow for multiple different FiveM servers to run behind this Proxy.<br>
Aswell ass CLN kicks happening at around 15 minutes and same goes for random game crashes, at least for me.

# NO SUPPORT
I will not help with installations and neither do I care if you fuck something up, because as said, dont use this in production.
